# TKI Social API - Architecture Exploration

This document captures our current thinking and open questions about the TKI Social API architecture. This is **exploratory work** - not final decisions.

## The Problem We're Solving

**Context:** TKI Binder is a complex ERP system. Social media platforms (Meta, LinkedIn, X, Reddit) have their own quirks and complexities.

**Question:** How do we connect these without making a mess?

## Current Thinking: Separate Service

**Why a separate service might make sense:**

- Binder team knows business logic, not social media APIs
- Social team can focus on platform quirks
- Clean separation of concerns

**Why it might not:**

- Adds complexity (more services to deploy/maintain)
- Network calls between services
- Could just be over-engineering

## The Data Flow Question (UNRESOLVED)

This is the big architectural question we're still figuring out:

### Option 1: Dumb Forwarder

```
Social Platform â†’ TKI Social API â†’ Forward everything to Binder
```

**Pros:** Simple, no local storage needed
**Cons:** Inefficient, lots of unnecessary API calls, tight coupling

### Option 2: Smart Processor

```
Social Platform â†’ TKI Social API â†’ Process/filter â†’ Send business events to Binder
```

**Pros:** Efficient, loose coupling, adds real value
**Cons:** Need local database, more complex

**Current status:** We have MongoDB connection tests working, but haven't decided which approach to take.

## What We've Built So Far

### Working Components

- âœ… **Express server** with comprehensive middleware stack
- âœ… **Production-ready routing** using controller/methods pattern
- âœ… **Meta adapter** (functional Facebook posting)
- âœ… **Binder service** (full API integration with comprehensive tests)
- âœ… **Portal service** (full API integration with comprehensive tests)
- âœ… **Database connections** (both TKI Portal and Binder MongoDB)
- âœ… **Webhook security** (signature verification for Meta & LinkedIn)
- âœ… **Comprehensive test suite** (30 tests across 4 files)
- âœ… **Production utilities** (logging, idempotency, graceful shutdown)
- âœ… **Azure-ready deployment** configuration

### Stub Components

- ðŸ”„ LinkedIn, X, Reddit adapters (placeholder code)
- ðŸ”„ Webhook handlers for X, Reddit (basic structure)

## Open Questions

### 1. Data Processing Strategy

- **Should TKI Social store and process social data locally?**
- Or just forward everything to Binder immediately?
- What's the right balance between efficiency and simplicity?

### 2. Database Usage

- We have MongoDB connections working, but what should we store?
- Raw webhook data? Processed events? Just tokens and cache?
- Or go database-free and keep it stateless?

### 3. Webhook Handling

- How much processing should happen in webhook handlers?
- Store first, then process async? Or process immediately?
- What gets sent to Binder and when?

### 4. Service Boundaries

- What belongs in TKI Social vs TKI Binder?
- Where's the line between "social platform stuff" and "business logic"?

## Next Steps to Explore

1. **Try the smart processor approach**
   - Build a simple webhook handler that stores data locally
   - Process it and send filtered results to Binder
   - See how it feels vs the dumb forwarder approach

2. **Define the service boundary**
   - What types of data/events should stay in TKI Social?
   - What should be immediately sent to Binder?

3. **Build one complete flow**
   - Pick one social platform webhook (like Meta comment)
   - Implement it end-to-end both ways
   - See which approach makes more sense

## Notes and Decisions

_This section will capture decisions as we make them, with reasoning_

- **Database connections:** Added MongoDB URIs and connection tests (Oct 6, 2025)
- **Reason:** Want to explore the "smart processor" approach, need database option available

- **Controller restructuring:** Moved to methods/ pattern (Oct 6, 2025)
- **Reason:** User's established pattern for clean separation of concerns

- **Removed over-engineering:** Eliminated cache service, simplified responses (Oct 6, 2025)
- **Reason:** 2-user system doesn't need complex caching, prefer simplicity

- **Added webhook security:** Implemented signature verification (Oct 6, 2025)
- **Reason:** Production security requirement for webhook authenticity

- **Comprehensive testing:** Added service tests, kept integration tests (Oct 6, 2025)
- **Reason:** Good for learning different test patterns, catches different issue types
